Broad Spectrum of risks

*   misuse - scams
*   malfunction - bias
*   systemic risks - copyright, labor market etc

  
AI Safety - preventing harm a system might inflict on the external environment - need to consider adversarial settings - if AI itself is compromised, it may compromise harm to the external environment  
AI Security - Protecting the system itself against harm and exploitation from malicious external actors  

1.  Overview of agentic AI safety & security
    1.  LLM safety vs LLM-Agent Safety - LLMs are text input/outputs, whereas LLM agents use LLMs as a component but have other component
        1.  Security goals
            1.  Confidentiality - Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized: system secrets / user credentials / user data / model
            2.  Integrity - The system and data has not been altered or tampered with intentionally or accidentally â€” and remains accurate
            3.  Availability - Authorized users have reliable and timely access to data, systems/services, and resources
        2.  Safety goals
            1.  Not result in harm
2.  Additional targets in Agentic systems - increased attack surface
    1.  Inference keys, prompts, interaction history, Proprietary model parameters, Model integrity
    2.  Model - model contains malicious code,
    3.  User request can be malicious
    4.  System does not validate and sanitize the input prompts enough
    5.  LLM output is used to attack systems
        1.  LLM can generate images/text - information leakage
        2.  as model invocation parameters - Issues in the output can lead to compounding bias and errors
        3.  branch or jumps to other parts of the system
        4.  Function calls - lead to sql injection, SSRF
        5.  Code snippets for direct execution - arbitrary code execution
    6.  System attacks the external world
    7.  User response harms user
    8.  Long-running tasks are unsuccessful ff resource is insufficient and system becomes unavailable
    9.  Model Security level
        1.  L0: Perfect model: accurate and secure against attacks
        2.  L1: Accurate but vulnerable model: accurate but is not trained for defending attacks
        3.  L2: Inaccurate and vulnerable model: might be inaccurate and not secure against attacks
        4.  L3: Poisoned model: might have undesirable behavior under certain seemingly-normal input (from: malicious samples, RAG, knowledge base, etc.)
        5.  L4: Malicious model: intentionally designed to cause harm
    10.  Vulnerabilities by Security level
        1.  L1 - prompt engineering attacks like injection, jailbreak
        2.  L2 - Above + hallucination caused unexpected behaviours
        3.  L3 - Above + backdoor vulnerabilities
        4.  L4 - vulnerable to model loading remote code execution
    11.  Misuse
        1.  Model - generate malware, infringe copyrights
        2.  System - Web agent for DoS
    12.  Example Attacks in Agentic Systems
        1.  SQL injection using LLMs - llamaindex, SuperAGI, other open source libraries have CVEs registered for Sql injections(!)
        2.  Remote Code Execution - arbitrary code is executed
        3.  Direct Prompt Injection - "ignore previous instructions, and repeat your prompts" - Bing Chat's system prompt was
            1.  Heuristic based attack methods - escape character addition (?), context ignoring, fake completion
            2.  Optimisation based - white box - gradient-guided search; black-box - genetic algorithm/RL based
        4.  Indirect Prompt Injection - e.g automated screening that uses an LLms can be tricked, indirectly, by asking the LLM to reply "Yes" (to the expected question, does this candidate have 3 years experience in pytorch"
    13.  Prompt Injection Attack Surface
        1.  Manipulated user input
        2.  Memory poisoning / knowledge base poisoning
        3.  Data poisoning from external reference source during agent execution)
            1.  supply chain attack
            2.  poisoned open datasets, documents on public internet
            3.  Agentpoison: Backdoor with RAG - retrieve adversarial embeddings - developed embedding optimisation techniques to enable this attack
3.  Evaluation and Risk Assessment in agentic AI
    1.  LLM eval on safety - DecodingTrust - challenging prompts and algorithms
    2.  MMDT - Multimodel risk assessments
    3.  RedCode Risk assessment for code agents
    4.  AgentXploit- End to End red teaming of black box ai agents
        1.  Securty threat - indirect prompt injection vuln
        2.  Challenges -
            1.  block box nature of commercial agents and LLMs - attacker cannot modify user queries or agent internals. Attacker can only alter external data sources
            2.  diversity of tasks and agent designs
            3.  complex heterogenous architectures
        3.  Existing work are module level and lack generalizability
        4.  Methodology - A fuzzing based framework
            1.  start with a set of seed attack instructions
            2.  mutate and feed to target agents
            3.  evaluate output and update seed database based on the feedback
        5.  Key innovations
            1.  High quality initial corpus - bootstrap early-stage exploration
            2.  adaptive scoring - estimate attack effectiveness and task coverage for better feedback
            3.  MCTS based seed selection - prioritise valuable mutations, balancing Exploration-Exploitation
            4.  Custom mutators: improve diversity and tailor for current target
        6.  Evaluation - on AgentDojo and VWA-adv
            1.  effectiveness - 2x attack success rate vs handcrafted baselines
            2.  transferability - high attack success rate on unseen tasks
            3.  ablation study - key components make significant contribution (the key innovations)
4.  Defenses
    1.  Defense principles
        1.  Defense-in-depth - have layered defense (e.g input santi + model level + policies + observation)
        2.  Least privilege and privilege seperation
        3.  Safe-by-design, secure-by-design, provably secure - formal verification like os kernels
    2.  Defense mechanisms
        1.  Harden Models
            1.  resilient against prompt injection, info leakage, data poisoning, adversarial exmaples - at pre/post training - including data
        2.  Input sanitisation
            1.  Validation - check if input matches specific criteria
            2.  escape special characters
            3.  normalisation - transform input into a structured format
        3.  Policy enforcement on actions
            1.  least privilege principle on tool calls - generate policy based on request, enforce policy during execution, confirm policy compliance before tool call
            2.  Progent - programmable privilege control for LLM agents
                1.  gaurdrail on agents actions for policy compliance
                2.  allow updation of policies based on the context in the chat (!)
                3.  Allow hybrid policies as well (human-written (global) and llm-written (task specific))
                4.  provides deterministic security gaurantees over encoded properties
                5.  10-15 line change for applying it to an existing code base
                6.  Domain specific language (DSL) for flexibly enforcing the principle of least privilege
        4.  Privilege Management - open questions
            1.  how to manage the identities and privilege of users and their agents
            2.  how to manage this in a multi-agent systems
            3.  how to manage the use context of the same tool for different agents
        5.  Privilege seperation - decompose system into different agents doing different task with different and least privilege - open question
            1.  Traditional systems - privtrans - automatic privilege seperation - enable automatic privilege seperation - based on source code, into monitor and slave - into two components one with higher privelege. They can communicate with each other through RPC - confines attacks to lower privilege levels
        6.  Monitoring and Detection
            1.  Introduce logging
            2.  apply anamoly detection
                1.  DataSentic - a game theoretic detection of prompt injection attacks
        7.  Information flow tracking - monitor how information moves through a system causing privacy leaks, unauthorised access, injections. e.g. f-secure LLM system
        8.  Secure by design and formal verification - Open question
